# Generic Guidelines
The following guidelines are the same for all training tracks:

## About Me
The About Me section should be divided into several sections: 
* Background: 1-2 paragraphs (paragraph should be 3-5 full sentences)
  * Describe yourself, your background, make it unique and personal
  * Should be mostly nontechnical (the rest of the portfolio is about your tech skills) 
  * Can include talking about your educational experience or any prior work experiences (technical, or non-technical)
* Interesting Facts About Myself 
  * This should be in bullet point format
  * 3-5 facts

Your "About Me" section is your chance to stand out to the client. It should be personal, unique, and authentic to who you are. Always keep in mind, though, that everything on your portfolio needs to be **professional**. When talking about yourself, be explicit about your WHY - your motivation, passion, drive, and enthusiasm for what you do.

Where does your WHY come from?  We are all products of our upbringing. The WHY is found by looking back at the experiences we had growing up. Growing up, there were times we naturally thrived and did things well. Those natural abilities manifested themselves in different ways and the key to finding your WHY is to identify those experiences and the patterns across them.

Here are some questions to ponder that can help you express your WHY: 

* What is one verb that describes you well? What adjective(s)? 
* Why did you choose a career in technology? 
* What motivates you to do your work? 
* What are your greatest accomplishments? 
* What do you enjoy the most about software development? 
* What are your career goals? 
* I wake up every day inspired to ____ so that _____ 

A good WHY statement has two parts: To __(contribution)__ so that __(impact)__. (But please don't copy this format directly, come up with your own formulation.)
