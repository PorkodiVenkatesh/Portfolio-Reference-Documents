> **About Me Example:**
> 
> _I am a full-stack software programmer and web developer with experience in data management, robotics and STEAM teaching/empowerment. I have always had a strong interest in computer science, but I have never had the funds to complete a professional degree. I recently did a Software Development Immersive with General Assembly while simultaneously working as a Data Coordinator at Nonviolence Institute, a nonprofit that works to reduce gang violence. Prior to this, I was a Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) teacher to underprivileged youth in Boston for 11 years. My goal is to use technology to uplift marginalized voices by solving problems, remembering to always temper technical capacity with humanity._
>
>_In my time with Revature I have deepened my knowledge of Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and data structures through class work and projects. I have also learned much about Salesforce, security, data modeling, Salesforce languages and frameworks like APEX, Visualforce, SOSL and SOQL. I have built on my knowledge of community organizing and lent it to teamwork and pair programming, even becoming the Scrum Master on my last project and leading daily ceremonies.It is important to me that as a community we can use technology to impact persistent problems both large and small. I want to be part of the solution. I look forward to bringing this mindset and Salesforce Ohana, as well as my experience, to your team.._
