# Salesforce CRM Training Track

Refer to the [Portfolio Guidelines](./salesforce-guidelines.md#portfolio-guidelines) and [Portfolio Samples](./salesforce-guidelines.md#portfolio-samples) to generate your portfolio through RevPro.

## Portfolio Guidelines

1.  Add **Job Title** as **Salesforce Developer**.
    
2.  **Industry equivalency** â€“ Add your top 5 key skills that are relevant to your core technology stack and the equivalency in months for each skill.
	- **Recommended Industry Equivalency Skills** - Salesforce, Apex, SOQL, SOSL, Data Modeling, Visualforce, Lightning, and JavaScript.
	- All industry equivalencies should not be the same
	- **HTML**, **CSS**, **Agile**, and **Git** are not allowed.
   
3.  **Skill Matrix**   
    -   This section used to mention the list of technologies/skills relevant to your core technology stack.
    -   Add a **minimum of 5 categories and 5 sub-skills each**.
    -   Equivalency for each skill must be between **3-24 months**.
    -   Check your capitalization of each technology or tool. Acronyms like SOQL or SOSL should be in all caps, proper nouns like Salesforce should be capitalized, compound words like JavaScript should have each word capitalized, and normal words should not be capitalized. If you have a question about it, just google it and check before you submit it!

4.  **Projects**   
    -   **Roles/Responsibilities** - Mention your Roles in the Project and add at least 8 bulleted responsibilities. Start your bullet points with active past verbs.
    -   **Make sure that the project order shows the most recent project to the least recent.**
